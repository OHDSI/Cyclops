Introduction
============

Cyclops (Cyclic coordinate descent for logistic, Poisson and survival analysis) is an R package for performing large scale regularized regressions.

Features
========
 - Regression of very large problems: up to millions of observations, millions of variables
 - Supports (conditional) logistic regression, (conditional) Poisson regression, as well as (conditional) Cox regression
 - Uses a sparse representation of the independent variables when appropriate
 - Supports using no prior, a normal prior or a Laplace prior
 - Supports automatic selection of hyperparameter through cross-validation
 - Efficient estimation of confidence intervals for a single variable using a profile-likelihood for that variable

Examples
========

```r
  library(Cyclops)
  cyclopsData <- createCyclopsDataFrame(formula)
  cyclopsFit <- fitCyclopsModel(cyclopsData)
```

Technology
============
Cyclops in an R package, with most functionality implemented in C++. Cyclops uses cyclic coordinate descent to optimize the likelihood function, which makes use of the sparse nature of the data.

System Requirements
===================
Requires R (version 3.1.0 or higher). Compilation on Windows requires [RTools >= 3.4]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

Installation
============
In R, to install the latest stable version, install from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("Cyclops")
```

To install the latest development version, install from GitHub. Note that this will require RTools to be installed.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("OHDSI/Cyclops")
```
