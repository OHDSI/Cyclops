\title{Cyclops: Cyclic coordinate descent for logistic, Poisson and survival analysis}
\description{
The Cyclops package incorporates cyclic coordinate descent and
majorization-minimization approaches to fit a variety of regression models
found in large-scale observational healthcare data.  Implementations focus
on computational optimization and fine-scale parallelization to yield
efficient inference in massive datasets.
